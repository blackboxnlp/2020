## Workshop programme 

BlackboxNLP2020 will be held virtually.
To promote accessibility across timezones, the programme is divided into three blocks. All talks and posters will be presented twice, in two different blocks.
A detailed version of the programme is available [here](program.md).

All plenary sessions will be held in zoom, where we will livestream the keynote and oral presentations, that are followed by a live Q&A. Questions can be asked in rocket chat during the presentations. Poster sessions will be held in gather town. **The links to the zoom session, gather.town space and the rocketchat channel can be found on the [EMNLP page of the workshop](https://virtual.2020.emnlp.org/workshop_WS-25.html)** (only accessible with conference registration).

## Invited speakers

### Idan Blank, UCLA 
*Understanding NLP’s blackbox with the brain’s blackbox and vice versa*

This talk will propose a bi-directional link between artificial and biological language processing mechanisms, demonstrating that each can be used as a tool for studying the other. First, I will ask: given what we know about language processing in the human brain and mind, what would success in artificial NLP look like? Specifically, I will focus on dissociations between language and the rest of high-level cognition to significantly narrow the space of “reasonable expectations” we should pose to language models. Next, I will ask: could state-of-the-art NLP systems provide a decent model of the human brain? Here, I will describe promising work demonstrating that some NLP systems can accurately predict brain responses to linguistic stimuli, and offer initial clues into what might drive such brain-machine correspondence.

### Roger Levy, MIT
*Evaluating and calibrating neural language models for human-like language processing*

With new architectures, larger datasets, and greater computational power, neural language models are getting better and better at the tasks they’re trained for and at offering out-of-the-box representations that can be fine-tuned for high performance in new tasks.  But are they getting more and more human-like?  Here we use linguistic theory and experimental methods inspired by psycholinguistic research to assess zero- and few-shot performance of contemporary neural models on a range of signature human-like language understanding behaviors.  While we find impressive successes by models trained on large quantities of text alone, we find clear advantages for models with a symbolic component when training data scale is small.  We also obtain success in calibrate models for more human-like processing.  Our results highlight the value of insights from psycholinguistics and cognitive science for neural language models of the future.

### Anna Rogers, University of Copenhagen
*When BERT plays the lottery, all tickets are winning!*

The lottery ticket hypothesis was originally developed for randomly initialized models, but might it also apply to pre-trained Transformers? If the "good" subnetworks exist, can they tell us anything about how BERT achieves its performance? 
## Workshop description

Neural networks have rapidly become a central component in NLP systems in
the last few years. The improvement in accuracy and performance brought by
the introduction of neural networks has typically come at the cost of our
understanding of the system: How do we assess what the representations and
computations are that the network learns? The goal of this workshop is to
bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network
black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology,
linguistics, and neuroscience. The topics of the workshop will include, but
are not limited to:

- Applying analysis techniques from neuroscience to analyze
high-dimensional vector representations (such as Haxby et al., 2001;
Kriegeskorte, 2008) in artificial neural networks;
- Analyzing the network's response to strategically chosen inputs in order
to infer the linguistic generalizations that the network has acquired
(e.g., Linzen et al., 2016; Loula et al., 2018);
- Examining the performance of the network on simplified or formal
languages (e.g., Hupkes et al., 2018; Lake et al., 2018);
- Proposing modifications to neural network architectures that can make
them more interpretable (e.g., Palanki et al., 2017);
- Scaling up neural network analysis techniques developed in the
connectionist literature in the 1990s (Elman, 1991);
- Testing whether interpretable information can be decoded from
intermediate representations (e.g., Adi et al.,  2017; Chrupala et al.,
2017; Hupkes et al., 2017);
- Translating insights on neural networks interpretation from the vision
domain (e.g., Zeiler & Fergus, 2014) to language;
- Explaining model predictions (e.g., Lei et al., 2016; Alvarez-Melis &
Jaakkola, 2017): What are ways to explain specific decisions made by neural
networks?
- Adversarial examples in NLP (e.g., Ebrahimi et al., 2018; Belinkov &
Bisk, 2018): How to generate them and how to evaluate their quality?
- Open-source tools for analyzing neural networks in NLP (e.g., Strobelt et
al., 2018; Rikters, 2018).
- Evaluation of analysis results: How do we know that the analysis is
valid?

BlackboxNLP 2020 is the third BlackboxNLP workshop. 
The programme and proceedings of the previous editions, which were held at EMNLP 2018 and ACL 2019, can be found [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2018/) and [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/2019/).

The call for papers text is available [here](http://blackboxnlp.github.io/cfp).

## Shared Interpretation Mission

BlackboxNLP 2020 will include a shared interpretation mission. Details available [here](https://blackboxnlp.github.io/shared).

## Paper submission 

We accept two types of papers

- <b>Archival papers</b>. These are papers reporting on completed, original and unpublished research, with maximum length of 8 pages + references. Papers shorter than this maximum are also welcome. An optional appendix may appear after the references in the same pdf file. Accepted papers are expected to be presented at the workshop and will be published in the workshop proceedings. They should report on obtained results rather than intended work. These papers will undergo double-blind peer-review, and should thus be anonymized. Archival papers will be included in the workshop proceedings and the ACL anthology.

- <b>Extended abstracts</b>. These may report on work in progress or may be cross submissions that have already appeared in a non-NLP venue. The extended abstracts are of maximum 2 pages + references. These submissions are non-archival in order to allow submission to another venue. The selection will not be based on a double-blind review and thus submissions of this type need not be anonymized. Abstracts will be posted on the workshop website but will not be included in the proceedings.

Both papers and abstracts should follow the official EMNLP 2020 style guidelines and should be submitted via softconf:

[https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/blackboxnlp2020/](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2020/blackboxnlp2020/)

Accepted submissions will be presented at the workshop: most as posters, some as oral presentations (determined by the program committee).

## Dual submissions and preprints 
Dual submissions with the main conference are allowed, but authors must declare dual submission by entering the paper's main conference submission id.
The reviews for the submission for the main conference will be automatically forwarded to the workshop and taken into consideration when your paper is evaluated.
Authors of dual-submission papers accepted to the main conference should retract them from the workshop by September 20.

Papers posted to preprint servers such as arxiv can be submitted
without any restrictions on when they were posted.

## Camera-ready information
Authors of accepted archival papers should upload the final version of their paper to the submission system by the camera-ready deadline. Authors may use one extra page to address reviewer comments, for a total of nine pages.
